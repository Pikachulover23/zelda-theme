Welcome to the readme file for my BetterDiscord theme project! 
My motivation for creating this theme was to customize my Discord experience and make it more visually appealing. I wanted to be able to express my personality through my Discord interface and make it more enjoyable to use.
I built this project because I saw a need for more customizable themes for Discord. While there are some great themes out there, I wanted to create something that was unique and tailored to my own tastes.
This theme solves the problem of a bland and generic Discord interface. It allows users to customize their Discord experience and make it more visually appealing, which can improve their overall experience on the platform.
Throughout the process of building this theme, I learned a lot about CSS and how to use it to customize web interfaces. I also learned about the BetterDiscord platform and how it can be used to enhance the Discord experience.
What makes my project stand out is its unique design and customization options. I've included a variety of customization options that allow users to really make the theme their own, and the design is eye-catching and visually appealing.
## Features
Customizable color scheme
Unique icons and interface design
Customizable fonts and text styles
Thank you for considering my BetterDiscord theme project! I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed creating it. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. azrymoonwind@gmail.com
